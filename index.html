		Tea. Just tea.
	</header>
	<p>I'm really sorry about this. I just love tea so much I had to make this.</p>
	<img src="tea1.jpeg"> 
	<p>I don't know what to say, really. It's just that... I'm so grateful for the existence of tea. Like I said before, I'm really sorry.</p>
	<img src="tea2.jpeg">
	<p>Why did I make this, you ask? You want to know why anybody would ever want to make what is, essentially, a fanpage for tea.</p>
	<img src="tea3.jpeg">
	<p>Well, the answer to that is quite simple, really. I was bored. This is the result. When I am bored, you never know what I will end up doing... or making, I guess.</p>
	<img src="tea4.jpeg">
	<p>Why are you still reading? What's the point? Are you really so intrigued by tea?</p>
	<img src="tea5.jpeg">
	<p>Do you actually like looking at random pictures of tea? Have I found another tea worshipper? (Oh how sTEAlthy of me it is to change topics.)</p>
	<img src="tea6.jpeg">
	<p>Yes, I see that you, too, have a love for tea. How interesting.</p>
	<img src="tea7.jpeg">
	<p>You know, green tea is very good for you. I wonder if looking at tea has the same health benefits as drinking it. Ah, that would be such a good hypothesis for a TEAsperiment.</p>
	<img src="tea8.jpeg">
	<p>Why would a TEAnage girl randomly make a tea website? What a brainTEAser.</p>
	<img src="tea9.jpeg">
	<p>Oh, how I wish I was drinking tea right now. But insTEAd, here I am, typing away on a keyboard.</p>
	<img src="tea10.jpeg">
	<p>Tea is really wonderful. It makes you feel at home, no matter where you are. Just that thought brings TEArs to my eyes.</p>
	<img src="tea11.jpeg">
	<p>At this point, you are probably getting pretty tired of scrolling through various images of tea.</p>
	<img src="tea12.jpeg">
	<p>Or, are you entranced? Does scrolling sTEAl your attention?</p>
	<img src="tea13.jpeg">
	<p>How much do you really love tea?</p>
	<img src="tea14.jpeg">
	<p>Enough to scroll through this entire page?</p>
	<img src="tea15.jpeg">
	<p>Congrats, you just scrolled through fifTEAn pictures of tea. Haha. I'm so funny. I really hope this entertained you. And once again, I'm sorry.</p>
